// Mainly 2 type of analysis = Experimental Analysis
// 2.Theortical Analysis

/// 3(Three) Cases :

// 1. Best Case  == Element is present at 1st Index /Array is sorted

// 2. Average CAse

// 3.Worst CAse = Element is not present in Array

/// Big-O Notation
// 1. We dont case the coefficient
// 2.We only focus on Higest Power

/// We will always find our time complexity for Worst Case
